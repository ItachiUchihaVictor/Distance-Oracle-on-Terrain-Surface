To perform experiment, you first need to use the terrain tool to generate 5 terrain datasets with 60k, 90k, 120k, 150k and 180k vertices, respectively, each of which is simplified from SF_high.off. Next, put the 5 datasets under this folder. The terrain tool could be found through the following link:

Then, you execute the script "exp" to get the experimental result.

Finally, plot the figure with the gnuplot script (.plt file).
