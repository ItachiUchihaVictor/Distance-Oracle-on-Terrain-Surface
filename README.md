# Distance-Oracle-on-Terrain-Surface

The project provides the implementation of the distance oracle on terrain surface stated in Reference. Please kindly cite the paper in the Reference if you used our code. 

There are three different types of distance queries on terrain surface, namely Vertex-to-Vertex (V2V) distance queries, Point-to-Point (P2P) distance queries and Arbitrary Point-to-Arbitrary Point (A2A) distance queries. We refer the readers to the paper in Reference for more details.
